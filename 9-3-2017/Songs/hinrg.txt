i feel love
i feel love
you make me feel mighty real
sunset people
remember me
megatron man
menergy
native love step by step
right on target
do ya wanna funk
its raining men
stormy weather
for your love
misty circles
searchin i gotta find a man
shoot your shot
relax
blue monday
smalltown boy
why
you spin me round like a record
whatever i do wherever i go
you think youre a man
two tribes
love kills
high energy
the second time
hit that perfect beat
i feel love
walk like a man
so macho
i love my radio
sex over the phone
venus
down and counting
dont leave me this way
two of hearts
you keep me hangin on
house of the rising sun
never can say goodbye
boom boom lets go back to my room
always on my mind
i should be so lucky
the locomotion
the sun aint gonna shine anymore
broken wings
youve lost that lovin feeling
i dont wanna get hurt
this time i know its for real
stop in the name of love
where the streets have no name i cant take my eyes off you
yesterday once more
take a chance on me
constant craving
losing my religion
u got 2 let the music
smells like teen spirit
move on baby
total eclipse of the heart
for all we know
live to tell
ooh aah just a little bit
its a sin
somewhere
around the world la la la la la
new york new york
flux
im a fire
love comes
i wanna go
sandm
remember me
axis
love is a bourgeois construct

#NPR Weekly Challenge #1 8-20-2017
#This week's challenge comes from listener Steve Baggish of Arlington, Mass. Think of two synonyms â€” one in 5 letters, the other in 4. The 5-letter word starts with S. The 4-letter word contains an S. Change one of these S's to an A. You can rearrange the result to name a group of people, in 9 letters, that ideally have those two adjectives describe them. What group is it?
